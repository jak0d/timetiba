# Conflict Resolution Suggestion Engine - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 6.3 "Build conflict resolution suggestion engine" has been successfully completed. This implementation provides a comprehensive AI-powered system for analyzing scheduling conflicts and generating intelligent resolution suggestions.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. ConflictAnalyzer Class
**Location**: `ai-service/services/conflict_analyzer.py`

The main engine that provides:
- **Conflict Pattern Analysis**: Identifies recurring patterns in scheduling conflicts
- **Resolution Suggestion Generation**: Creates intelligent suggestions for resolving conflicts
- **Solution Ranking**: Ranks suggestions by quality, feasibility, and effort
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk of implementing each suggestion
- **Alternative Path Generation**: Creates multiple resolution strategies

### 2. Core Data Models

#### ConflictPattern
- Represents recurring conflict patterns
- Calculates severity scores based on frequency and impact
- Tracks entities involved in patterns

#### ResolutionSuggestion
- Encapsulates a single resolution suggestion
- Includes confidence calculation based on score and effort
- Contains detailed parameters for implementation

### 3. Resolution Strategy Types

The engine supports multiple resolution strategies:

1. **Venue Reassignment** (`reassign_venue`)
   - Moves sessions to alternative venues
   - Considers capacity and equipment requirements

2. **Session Rescheduling** (`reschedule`)
   - Changes session timing to avoid conflicts
   - Respects availability constraints

3. **Lecturer Reassignment** (`reassign_lecturer`)
   - Assigns different qualified lecturers
   - Checks subject expertise and availability

4. **Group Splitting** (`split_group`)
   - Divides large groups into smaller sessions
   - Handles capacity overflow situations

5. **Generic Resolutions**
   - Fallback strategies for unknown conflict types

### 4. Intelligent Analysis Features

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies frequently occurring conflict types
- Detects entities that are "hotspots" for conflicts
- Calculates pattern severity scores

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Venue Scarcity**: Detects overutilized venues
- **Lecturer Overload**: Identifies overworked lecturers
- **Time Slot Congestion**: Finds peak usage periods

#### Entity Impact Analysis
- Tracks which entities are most involved in conflicts
- Analyzes conflict distribution across entity types
- Provides targeted recommendations

### 5. Quality Evaluation System

Each suggestion is evaluated across multiple dimensions:

- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of all factors
- **Feasibility Score**: How realistic the suggestion is to implement
- **Impact Score**: Positive effect on conflict resolution
- **Effort Score**: Implementation difficulty (inverse of effort level)
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Confidence**: Algorithm's confidence in the suggestion

### 6. Alternative Path Generation

The engine can generate multiple alternative resolution strategies:
- **Low-effort path**: Prioritizes easy-to-implement solutions
- **High-score path**: Focuses on most effective solutions
- **Balanced path**: Combines effectiveness with feasibility

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = ConflictAnalyzer()

# Analyze conflicts
analysis = analyzer.analyze_conflicts(conflicts, solution, entities)

# Generate suggestions
suggestions = analyzer.generate_resolution_suggestions(
    conflicts, solution, entities, max_suggestions=5
)

# Evaluate top suggestion
evaluation = analyzer.evaluate_suggestion_quality(
    suggestions[0], conflicts, solution, entities
)

# Generate alternatives
alternatives = analyzer.generate_multiple_alternatives(
    conflicts, solution, entities, num_alternatives=3
)
```
