# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Timetable Import feature enables users to upload CSV or Excel files containing timetable data and automatically import all timetable elements into the webapp. The system will intelligently parse the uploaded files, match existing entities (venues, lecturers, courses, student groups), create new entities as needed, and populate the timetable with the imported schedule data. This feature transforms the manual data entry process into an efficient bulk import workflow, allowing institutions to quickly migrate existing timetables or import schedules from external systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want to upload CSV or Excel files containing timetable data, so that I can quickly import existing schedules without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the import interface THEN the system SHALL provide file upload functionality supporting CSV and Excel (.xlsx, .xls) formats
2. WHEN a file is selected for upload THEN the system SHALL validate file format, size limits (max 10MB), and basic structure
3. WHEN file validation passes THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the detected data structure and column mappings
4. IF file validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating the issues and required format
5. WHEN file upload is successful THEN the system SHALL store the file temporarily and proceed to data parsing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want the system to automatically detect and map columns in my import file, so that I can easily configure how my data maps to system entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL analyze column headers and suggest mappings to system fields (course name, lecturer, venue, time, etc.)
2. WHEN column mapping is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow manual adjustment of field mappings through dropdown selections
3. WHEN mapping configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are mapped
4. IF required mappings are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight missing fields and prevent import until resolved
5. WHEN mappings are confirmed THEN the system SHALL save the mapping configuration for future imports of similar files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want the system to intelligently match imported data with existing entities, so that duplicate venues, lecturers, and courses are not created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing imported data THEN the system SHALL attempt to match venue names with existing venues using fuzzy matching algorithms
2. WHEN processing lecturer information THEN the system SHALL match by name and email address to identify existing lecturers
3. WHEN processing course data THEN the system SHALL match by course code and name to identify existing courses
4. IF exact matches are not found THEN the system SHALL present potential matches with confidence scores for user review
5. WHEN matches are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL allow users to manually confirm matches or create new entities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want the system to create new entities automatically when they don't exist, so that all imported timetable data can be properly stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imported data contains new venues THEN the system SHALL create venue records with available information and default values for missing fields
2. WHEN new lecturers are detected THEN the system SHALL create lecturer profiles with imported data and prompt for additional required information
3. WHEN new courses are found THEN the system SHALL create course records and establish relationships with associated lecturers and student groups
4. IF new student groups are identified THEN the system SHALL create group records with imported enrollment information
5. WHEN creating new entities THEN the system SHALL validate all data against business rules and constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want to review and validate imported data before final import, so that I can ensure accuracy and make corrections if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive preview showing all entities to be created or updated
2. WHEN preview is shown THEN the system SHALL highlight potential issues, conflicts, or data quality concerns
3. WHEN reviewing data THEN the system SHALL allow editing of individual records before final import
4. IF scheduling conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL display clash information and suggest resolutions
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation before proceeding with the import

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want detailed import results and error reporting, so that I can understand what was imported successfully and address any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN import processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report showing successful imports, errors, and warnings
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with row numbers and suggested corrections
3. WHEN partial imports succeed THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which records were imported and which failed
4. IF data quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL generate warnings with recommendations for data cleanup
5. WHEN import is complete THEN the system SHALL provide options to download error reports and retry failed imports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want to handle large import files efficiently, so that I can import extensive timetable data without system performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL implement batch processing to handle imports in manageable chunks
2. WHEN import is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators showing completion percentage
3. WHEN processing takes extended time THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue other work while import runs in background
4. IF import process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL provide resume functionality to continue from the last successful batch
5. WHEN import completes THEN the system SHALL send notifications to the user regardless of their current location in the application

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system user, I want import templates and documentation, so that I can prepare my data in the correct format for successful import.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing import functionality THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable CSV and Excel templates with proper column headers
2. WHEN templates are provided THEN they SHALL include sample data demonstrating correct format and required values
3. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on data preparation and formatting requirements
4. IF format requirements change THEN the system SHALL maintain version control of templates and notify users of updates
5. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and examples for each field type and format requirement
