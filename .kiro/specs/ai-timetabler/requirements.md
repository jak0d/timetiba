# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Timetabler is a comprehensive SaaS solution designed to automate and optimize the creation of academic and organizational schedules. The system will intelligently manage complex scheduling constraints including venue availability, lecturer schedules, student groups, and resource allocation while providing AI-powered clash detection and resolution suggestions. The platform aims to transform the traditionally manual and error-prone process of timetabling into an efficient, automated workflow that saves time and reduces conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want to input and manage all scheduling entities (venues, lecturers, courses, student groups), so that I can have a centralized database for timetable generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces to create, read, update, and delete venues with capacity and equipment details
2. WHEN an administrator adds lecturer information THEN the system SHALL store lecturer availability, subject expertise, and preference constraints
3. WHEN course information is entered THEN the system SHALL capture course duration, frequency, required resources, and student group assignments
4. WHEN student group data is provided THEN the system SHALL record group size, course enrollments, and scheduling preferences
5. IF duplicate entities are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and suggest existing matches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want the system to automatically detect scheduling clashes, so that I can avoid double-booking resources and conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timetable is generated or modified THEN the system SHALL scan for venue double-bookings across all time slots
2. WHEN lecturer assignments are made THEN the system SHALL verify no lecturer is scheduled in multiple locations simultaneously
3. WHEN student groups are assigned THEN the system SHALL ensure no group has overlapping class schedules
4. IF any clash is detected THEN the system SHALL highlight the conflict with detailed information about affected entities
5. WHEN clashes are found THEN the system SHALL prevent timetable finalization until conflicts are resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want AI-powered suggestions to resolve scheduling conflicts, so that I can quickly find optimal solutions without manual trial and error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a clash is detected THEN the AI system SHALL analyze all affected constraints and generate multiple resolution options
2. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL prioritize solutions that minimize disruption to existing schedules
3. WHEN proposing alternatives THEN the system SHALL consider lecturer preferences, venue suitability, and student convenience
4. IF multiple solutions exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by optimization score and present top 5 options
5. WHEN a suggestion is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the changes and re-validate the entire timetable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a lecturer, I want to set my availability and preferences, so that the timetabling system can respect my constraints and optimize my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lecturer logs into the system THEN they SHALL be able to view and edit their availability calendar
2. WHEN setting availability THEN the system SHALL allow blocking specific time slots, days, or date ranges
3. WHEN preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL save preferred time slots, maximum daily hours, and break requirements
4. IF availability conflicts with existing assignments THEN the system SHALL notify the administrator and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN preferences change THEN the system SHALL automatically re-evaluate affected timetables and flag potential issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a timetable administrator, I want to generate optimized timetables automatically, so that I can create efficient schedules that satisfy all constraints with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timetable generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL process all constraints and generate a conflict-free schedule
2. WHEN optimizing THEN the AI SHALL minimize gaps in student schedules and maximize venue utilization
3. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL respect all hard constraints (availability, capacity) and optimize soft constraints (preferences)
4. IF no valid solution exists THEN the system SHALL identify the conflicting constraints and suggest modifications
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report showing optimization metrics and any remaining issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to export and share timetables in multiple formats, so that I can distribute schedules to stakeholders and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate timetables in PDF, Excel, CSV, and iCal formats
2. WHEN sharing timetables THEN the system SHALL provide role-based views (student view, lecturer view, room view)
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include filtering options by date range, department, or specific entities
4. IF changes are made to published timetables THEN the system SHALL notify affected users and provide updated exports
5. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for real-time timetable data access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure AI optimization parameters and business rules, so that the timetabling algorithm aligns with institutional policies and priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set weight factors for different optimization criteria
2. WHEN defining rules THEN the system SHALL allow creation of custom constraints and penalty functions
3. WHEN AI parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL validate settings and show impact on existing timetables
4. IF rule conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight incompatible settings and suggest resolutions
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before applying to active timetables

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a timetable user, I want real-time notifications about schedule changes, so that I can stay informed about updates that affect me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timetable changes occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to all affected users within 5 minutes
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include change details, reason, and new schedule information
3. WHEN users receive notifications THEN they SHALL be able to acknowledge receipt and provide feedback
4. IF critical changes occur THEN the system SHALL escalate notifications through multiple channels (email, SMS, in-app)
5. WHEN notification preferences are set THEN users SHALL be able to customize frequency and delivery methods
